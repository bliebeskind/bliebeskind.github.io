## Tree Intro

I care about phylogenetic methods, but a lot of biologists see them as just a tool, if not a nuisance. I'd
like it if everyone cared about them like I do, but I realize that scientists are diverse. Rather than be
grumpy about it, I've made a little cheat sheet so that people can make a robust phylogeny, interpret it
without egregious errors, and get on with the rest of their research. I call it, [*Trees For People Who Don't
Care About Trees*] (files/TreeIntro.pdf).
