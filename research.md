## Evolution of the Nervous System

When did the nervous system originate and what were the key changes associated with this important evolutionary
event? My PhD work explored this question by investigating the evolutionary history of voltage-gated ion channels,
the main drivers of electrical excitability in nervous systems. I did this work in the labs of 
[Harold Zakon](http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/neuroscience/HaroldZakon/) and [David Hillis](http://www.zo.utexas.edu/faculty/antisense/)
at University of Texas at Austin.

Here's a blog I wrote for [BEACON](http://beacon-center.org/)
a few years back: [Electrical Life](http://beacon-center.org/blog/2013/10/14/beacon-researchers-at-work-electrical-life/)

## The Comparative Approach to Human Disease

Organismal diversity has two main, non-independent causes: shared ancestry (history), and the evolutionary process (selection).
How can we leverage these two causes to better understand the genetics of human disease? I recently wrote a [review of this 
subject](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X15000878/) that explores the variety of ways that
researchers leverage organismal diversity, model systems, and evolutionary reasoning to discover new genes associated with
human diseases. In the [Marcotte](http://www.marcottelab.org/index.php/Main_Page) and [Aldrich](https://clm.utexas.edu/AldrichLab/)
labs I use a combination of yeast genetics (pic above), systems biology, and bioinformatics to better understand the
evolutionary process across all the levels of organisation; from the nucleotide, through the protein and cellular levels,
and on up to the whole organism.
