## Evolution of the Nervous System

When did the nervous system originate and what were the key changes associated with this important evolutionary
event? My PhD work explored this question by investigating the evolutionary history of voltage-gated ion channels,
the main drivers of electrical excitability in nervous systems. I did this work in the labs of 
[Harold Zakon](http://www.biosci.utexas.edu/neuroscience/HaroldZakon/) and [David Hillis](http://www.zo.utexas.edu/faculty/antisense/)
at University of Texas at Austin.

Here's a blog I wrote for [BEACON](http://beacon-center.org/)
a few years back: [Electrical Life](http://beacon-center.org/blog/2013/10/14/beacon-researchers-at-work-electrical-life/)
